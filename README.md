Clinic Management System
The Clinic Management System presented here is a comprehensive application designed to streamline the operations of a medical clinic by efficiently managing doctors, patients, and appointments. This system employs object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, providing a robust and scalable solution.

Key components of the system include:
Doctor Management: The system categorizes doctors into different specialties and departments, allowing patients to easily find doctors based on their needs. It includes both general practitioners and specialists, demonstrating inheritance and method overriding by implementing abstract methods in different subclasses.
Patient Management: The system facilitates the storage and retrieval of patient information associated with specific doctors. Patients can be linked to doctors based on their specialty, and their information is stored and managed efficiently, highlighting the system's use of classes and data encapsulation.
Appointment Scheduling and Patient Record Maintenance: The system provides functionalities for recording patient details and managing patient-doctor associations. It ensures data persistence by saving patient information to a file, which can be accessed and managed for future reference.
User Interaction through a Simple Interface: The system features a user-friendly interface that allows users to navigate various functionalities, such as finding doctors, selecting them, and viewing associated patient lists. This makes it accessible and easy to use for clinic staff and patients.
